# Factorizations
This repository contains tool for solving LU factorization in linear algebra using three algorithms that are listed below. All three algorithms have different characteristics, based on the input matrix and certain needs from results.
Algorithms are:
1. LDLT
2. Cholesky
3. Crout

Goal of tool was to achieve significant speedup using parallel implementation in OpenMP.
Tool was developed by:
